# HELLO  

My name is Eugene Kozlakov. You've found my Git Repo page for D6! As of right now there is currently as much work as I could get done on the 10 labs across the course. Here and there I added a few easter eggs in my fiels, but I doubt they've come through.

Have fun looking around, and reach out if there are any questions, comments, or concerns you may have.

In the meantime, please recall this quote in times of need:
