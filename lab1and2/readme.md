# LAB 2G and 2H: Audio and Image Recording  
## LAB 2G: Audio Recording 
For this section of the lab, I used a the microphone of a USB webcam as my acting microphone and a pair of ordinary earbuds for playback through the Raspberry Pi 4B's 3.5 mm  
audio jack. I used the "arecord" service to record audio and "aplay" service to play back the produced .wav files. Below are screenshots of the commands and the subsequent  
audio files.   

### "test.wav" - First Audio file
For this audio file, I simply typed `arecord test.wav` to get started.
